what:
  q: What are LU Server Projects?
  a: This community of projects aims to provide the capability to play the
    LEGO&reg; Universe MMO, shuttered in February 2012 after a roughly one year
    run, through emulating the original servers. This is done thanks to the hard
    work of many fans in reverse engineering packet captures and the game client,
    and also opens up the possibility for further creativity through
    customization by dedicated fans.

  q: How did it all start?
  a: Around the time of the games closure, Pwjones was able to capture a
    significant volume of packets from the live LU servers, which were then able
    to be decrypted by Humanoid, who also wrote the very first server prototype
    playing back these captures. Not soon thereafter, the community began to
    overhype the little that was available in this implementation, and due to
    various reasons multiple fractures developed among the community. Multiple
    groups formed to work on furthering the understanding and implementation of
    LU servers, and through the formation, dissolution, and consolidation of
    these projects, the current major projects have come in to being, as well as
    paving the way for other experimental utilities and implementations.
